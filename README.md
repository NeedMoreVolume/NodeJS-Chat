# NodeJS-Chat
Server side implementation of a chatroom. Can handle any websocket based connection.

This implementation utilizes a MongoDB for storing messages sent to the chatroom. Simply write a simple client to connect on port 8080, and all connected clients will recieve any message that is sent to the server.
